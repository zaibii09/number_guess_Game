Hello this is a number guessing game which is created in the python language...This is my first project ever so I am very excited to share it !

secret_number = 9
guess_count = 0
guess_limit = 3
while guess_count <guess_limit:
    guess = int(input('Guess:'))
    guess_count += 1
    if guess == secret_number:
        print('you won!')
        break
else:
    print('sorry you failed! ')
